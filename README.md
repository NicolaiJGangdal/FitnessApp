# Fitness App


This project was created in xCode. <br />
I have created this project to get experience within app developement <br />
and coding in Swift as well as getting a notebook replacement in the gym. <br /> 

### App Features:

`Tailor workouts to your own need` <br />
`Log workouts` <br />
`Log sets, reps and weight for each exercise` <br />
`See progress comparing old workouts to new ones` <br />


##

### `Home Screen`

This is the Home Screen. <br />
Here the user can edit the names of each of the seven day-cards. <br />
Inside the day-cards is where each workout is kept. <br />
Hoping to have a link to App Store soon, working on final touches <br />
for apple to approve the app. <br />

### `Workouts`

This is the Workout Screen <br />
Here we can add and remove exercises. <br />
The next step for the app is to start a <br />
workout and save them in a calendar. <br />
