# Fitness App


This project was created in xCode. <br />
I have created this project to get experience within app developement <br />
and coding in Swift as well as getting a notebook replacement in the gym. <br /> 

### App Features:

`Tailor workouts to your own need` <br />
`Log workouts` <br />
`Log sets, reps and weight for each exercise` <br />
`See progress comparing old workouts to new ones` <br />


##

### `Home Screen`

This is the Home-page, where the user can select a number. <br />
If the user is not satisfied with the number they can erase it using the Reset button. <br />
When the user has put in a number between 1 and 99 they can press Confirm to start playing. <br />
